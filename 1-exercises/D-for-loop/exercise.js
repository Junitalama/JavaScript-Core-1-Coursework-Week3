/*
    for loops can be useful when we already know exactly how many times we want to loop.

    Below we have 2 arrays which have exactly the same number of values.
        - The first array is a list of writers
        - The second array is a list of ages
    The writers in the first array correspond with the ages in the second array.
    For example, Virginia Woolf is 59 years old.

    Using a for loop, output to the console a line about the age of each writer.

The output should look something like this:

Virginia Woolf is 59 years old
Zadie Smith is 40 years old

Bell Hooks is 63 years old
